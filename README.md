## Exp 1: Testing Wukong with different $\Delta$ parameters

### 1. Pic1

#### Setting:

- node number: $n=10$
- favorable situation: $f=0$
- $\Delta$: 0.5s and 1s

#### Results:

Wukong with $\Delta$ as 1s outperforms that with 0.5s in the favorablt situation.

### 2. Pic2

#### Setting:

- node number: $n=10$
- unfavorable situation: $f=3$
- $\Delta$: 1s and 4s

#### Results:

Wukong with $\Delta$ as 1s outperforms that with 4s in the unfavorable situation.
